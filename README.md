##### MacEditor 2.0
> 
> I made MacEditor to be a free application that could open/read, write/edit with ease.
> And I hope that it stays like this because I don't want people to decompile it and
> Figure out what I did to make a better editor (even though it'll never happen).
> I just hope that people enjoy this application because it IS the best I will ever do in C#.

##### Changes
> 
> Do note that the application REQUIRES [kernel32.dll](https://dllme.com/dll/files/kernel32_dll.html) to run
> or else it WILL NOT WORK. I actually did implement a little system where if it doesn't detect the file,
> it WILL error and tell you to download it. Also, I added kernel32.dll because I figured out how to do
> built-in file methods using kernel32.dll. I figured out how to read from/write to files using the memory functions.
