# MacEditor 2.0
> 
> I made MacEditor to be a free application that could open/read, write/edit with ease.
> And I hope that it stays like this because I don't want people to decompile it and
> Figure out what I did to make a better editor (even though it'll never happen).
> I just hope that people enjoy this application because it IS the best I will ever do in C#.
